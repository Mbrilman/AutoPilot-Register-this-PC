# SECURITY REMINDER:
# Even with .gitignore, already-tracked files will remain in Git history.
# If you accidentally committed sensitive files:
#   1. Immediately notify IT Security
#   2. Rotate compromised credentials
#   3. Use tools like BFG Repo-Cleaner to remove from history
#   4. Force push cleaned repository (requires team coordination)
